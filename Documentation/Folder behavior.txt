How converter functions *should* handle the extraction/packing

TXR > BMP/PNG

convertTXRtoBMP(input, output, png_output=False)

Set png_output=True to export PNG(s) instead

Convert specific TXR and put BMP(s) in output folder:
input = "./folder/texture.txr"
output = "./another folder/"

Convert specific TXR and put BMP(s) in the same folder:
input = "./folder/texture.txr"
output = ""

Convert all TXR in input folder and put BMP(s) in differemt folder:
input = "./folder/"
output = "./another folder/"

Convert all TXR in input folder and put BMP(s) in the same folder:
input = "./folder/"
output = ""



BMP/PNG > TXR

convertBMPtoTXR(input, output, png_input=False)

Set png_input=True to convert PNG(s) instead

Convert specific bmp from input folder into specific txr/bg in output folder:
input = "./folder/image.txr.0.bmp"
output = "./another folder/image.txr"
or
input = "./folder/image.bg.0.bmp"
output = "./another folder/image.bg" for .bg loading screen file

Convert specific bmp in input folder and put txr in output folder:
input = "./folder/image.bmp"
output = "./another folder/"

Convert specific bmp in input folder and put txr in the same folder:
input = "./folder/texture.bmp"
output = ""

Convert all bmp in input folder and put txr(s) in the same folder:
input = "./folder/"
output = ""
It will also group BMPs into separate TXR's based on the file names.
texture_name.txr.X.bmp -> texture_name.txr
X shows the order in which textures will be placed in the txr
